when responding regarding code snippets.  
always reference the filename and give full methods of modification and full files for html files.  Asking for clarity is fine.

Reference line numbers where and when possible.

Ask for files if you need to?  dont assume you know the latest.

If a request is unclear or ambiguous, ask I am happy to clarify.
